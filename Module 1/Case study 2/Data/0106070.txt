  Tight frames and rank-one quantum measurements are shown to be intimately related. In fact, the family of normalized tight frames for the space in which a quantum mechanical system lies is precisely the family of rank-one generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) on that space. Using this relationship, frame-theoretical analogues of various quantum-mechanical concepts and results are developed.
  The analogue of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is specified (constrained least-squares frame (CLSF)) and the case in which the scaling is free (unconstrained least-squares frame (ULSF)). The well-known canonical frame is shown to be proportional to the ULSF and to coincide with the CLSF with a certain scaling.
  Finally, the canonical frame vectors corresponding to a geometrically uniform vector set are shown to be geometrically uniform and to have the same symmetries as the original vector set.
