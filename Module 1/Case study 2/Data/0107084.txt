  This Letter presents a method of electron entanglement generation. The system under consideration is a single-level quantum dot with one input and two output leads. The leads are arranged such that the dot is empty, single electron tunneling is suppressed by energy conservation, and two-electron virtual co-tunneling is allowed. This yields a pure, non-local spin-singlet state at the output leads. Coulomb interaction is the nonlinearity essential for entanglement generation, and, in its absence, the singlet state vanishes. This type of electron entanglement is a four-wave mixing process analogous to the photon entanglement generated by a Chi-3 parametric amplifier.
