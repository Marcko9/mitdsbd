  We measured the intrawell energy relaxation time τ_{d} between macroscopic quantum levels in the double well potential of a Nb persistent-current qubit. Interwell population transitions were generated by irradiating the qubit with microwaves. Zero population in the initial well was then observed due to a multi-level decay process in which the initial population relaxed to the lower energy levels during transitions. The qubit's decoherence time, determined from τ_{d}, is longer than 20 microseconds, holding the promise of building a quantum computer with Nb-based superconducting qubits.
