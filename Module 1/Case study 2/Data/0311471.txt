  Superconductive quantum circuits (SQCs) comprise quantized energy levels that may be coupled via microwave electromagnetic fields. Described in this way, one may draw a close analogy to atoms with internal (electronic) levels coupled by laser light fields. In this Letter, we present a superconductive analog to electromagnetically induced transparency (S-EIT) that utilizes SQC designs of present day experimental consideration. We discuss how S-EIT can be used to establish macroscopic coherence in such systems and, thereby, utilized as a sensitive probe of decoherence.
