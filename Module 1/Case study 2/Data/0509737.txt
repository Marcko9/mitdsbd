  We propose a method to couple metastable flux-based qubits to superconductive resonators based on a quantum-optical Raman excitation scheme that allows for the deterministic generation of stationary and propagating microwave Fock states and other weak quantum fields. Moreover, we introduce a suitable microwave quantum homodyne technique, with no optical counterpart, that enables the measurement of relevant field observables, even in the presence of noisy amplification devices.
