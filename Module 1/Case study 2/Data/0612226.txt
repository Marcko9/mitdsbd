  We consider a superconducting charge qubit coupled to distinct orthogonal electromagnetic field modes belonging to a coplanar wave guide and a microstrip transmission line resonators. This architecture allows the simultaneous implementation of a Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings dynamics, a resonant method for generating mesoscopic qubit-field superpositions and for field-state reconstruction. Furthermore, we utilize this setup to propose a field measurement technique that is, in principle, robust to qubit dephasing and field relaxation due to a fast pre-measurement.
