  We produce large numbers of low-energy ions by photoionization of laser-cooled atoms inside a surface-electrode-based Paul trap. The isotope-selective trap loading rate of $4\times10^{5}$ Yb$^{+}$ ions/s exceeds that attained by photoionization (electron impact ionization) of an atomic beam by four (six) orders of magnitude. Traps as shallow as 0.13 eV are easily loaded with this technique. The ions are confined in the same spatial region as the laser-cooled atoms, which will allow the experimental investigation of interactions between cold ions and cold atoms or Bose-Einstein condensates.
