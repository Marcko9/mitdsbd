  A hereditary property of graphs is a collection of graphs which is closed under taking induced subgraphs. The speed of ¶is the function n \mapsto |¶_n|, where ¶_n denotes the graphs of order n in ¶. It was shown by Alekseev, and by Bollobas and Thomason, that if ¶is a hereditary property of graphs then |¶_n| = 2^{(1 - 1/r + o(1))n^2/2}, where r = r(¶) \in \N is the so-called `colouring number' of ¶. However, their results tell us very little about the structure of a typical graph G \in ¶.
  In this paper we describe the structure of almost every graph in a hereditary property of graphs, ¶. As a consequence, we derive essentially optimal bounds on the speed of ¶, improving the Alekseev-Bollobas-Thomason Theorem, and also generalizing results of Balogh, Bollobas and Simonovits.
