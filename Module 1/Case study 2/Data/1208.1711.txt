We report a giant spin Hall effect (SHE) in β-W thin films. Using spin torque induced ferromagnetic resonance with a β-W/CoFeB bilayer microstrip we determine the spin Hall angle to be |θ|=0.30\pm0.02, large enough for an in-plane current to efficiently reverse the orientation of an in-plane magnetized CoFeB free layer of a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction adjacent to a thin β-W layer. From switching data obtained with such 3-terminal devices we independently determine |θ|=0.33\pm0.06. We also report variation of the spin Hall switching efficiency with W layers of different resistivities and hence of variable (α and β) phase composition.
