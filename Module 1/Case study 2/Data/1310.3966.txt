We experimentally study the behavior of a parametrically pumped nonlinear oscillator, which is based on a superconducting λ/4 resonator, and is terminated by a flux-tunable SQUID. We extract parameters for two devices. In particular, we study the effect of the nonlinearities in the system and compare to theory. The Duffing nonlinearity, α, is determined from the probe-power dependent frequency shift of the oscillator, and the nonlinearity, β, related to the parametric flux pumping, is determined from the pump amplitude for the onset of parametric oscillations. Both nonlinearities depend on the parameters of the device and can be tuned in-situ by the applied dc flux. We also suggest how to cancel the effect of βby adding a small dc flux and a pump tone at twice the pump frequency.
