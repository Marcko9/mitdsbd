Graphene, owing to its ability to support plasmon polariton waves in the terahertz frequency range, enables the miniaturization of antennas to allow wireless communications among nanosystems. One of the main challenges in the demonstration of graphene antennas is finding suitable terahertz sources to feed the antenna. This paper estimates the performance of a graphene RF plasmonic micro-antenna fed with a photoconductive source. The terahertz source is modeled and, by means of a full-wave EM solver, the radiated power of the device is estimated with respect to material, laser illumination and antenna geometry parameters. The results show that the proposed device radiates terahertz pulses with an average power up to 1$Î¼$W, proving the feasibility of feeding miniaturized graphene antennas with photoconductive materials.
