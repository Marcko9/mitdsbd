In 1987, Kolaitis, Prömel and Rothschild proved that, for every fixed $r \in \mathbb{N}$, almost every $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph is $r$-partite. In this paper we extend this result to all functions $r = r(n)$ with $r \leqslant (\log n)^{1/4}$. The proof combines a new (close to sharp) supersaturation version of the Erdős-Simonovits stability theorem, the hypergraph container method, and a counting technique developed by Balogh, Bollobás and Simonovits.
