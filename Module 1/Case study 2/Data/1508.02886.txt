We propose and demonstrate a new read-out technique for a superconducting qubit by dispersively coupling it to a Josephson parametric oscillator. We employ a tunable quarter-wavelength superconducting resonator and modulate its resonant frequency at twice its value with an amplitude surpassing the threshold for parametric instability. We map the qubit states onto two distinct states of classical parametric oscillation: one oscillating state, with $185\pm15$ photons in the resonator, and one with zero oscillation amplitude. This high contrast obviates a following quantum-limited amplifier. We demonstrate proof-of-principle, single-shot readout performance, and present an error budget indicating that this method can surpass the fidelity threshold required for quantum computing.
