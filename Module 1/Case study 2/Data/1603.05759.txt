Single photon sources are of paramount importance in quantum communication, quantum computation, and quantum metrology. In particular, there is great interest to realize scalable solid state platforms that can emit triggered photons on demand to achieve scalable nanophotonic networks. We report on a visible-spectrum single photon emitter in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC). The emitter is photostable at room- and low-temperature enabling photon counts per second (cps) in excess of 2$\times$10$^6$ from unpatterned, bulk SiC. It exists in two orthogonally polarized states, which have parallel absorption and emission dipole orientations. Low temperature measurements reveal a narrow zero phonon line (linewidth $<0.1~$nm) that accounts for $>30~$% of the total photoluminescence spectrum.
