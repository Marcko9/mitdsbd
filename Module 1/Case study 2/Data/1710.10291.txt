Recently there has been an explosion of books and articles complaining about the weirdness of Quantum Mechanics and crying out for a solution. Three problems in particular have been singled out: the double-slit experiment, the measurement problem, and entanglement. One of these (entanglement) was the subject of an episode of the BBC TV show NOVA. In this article it is shown that Quantum Field Theory, as formulated by Julian Schwinger, provides simple solutions for all three problems, and others as well.
