We propose two schemes for selective-repeat ARQ protocols over packet erasure channels with unreliable feedback: (i) a hybrid ARQ protocol with soft combining at the receiver, and (ii) a coded ARQ protocol, by building on the uncoded baseline scheme for ARQ, developed by Ausavapattanakun and Nosratinia. Our method leverages discrete-time queuing and coding theory to analyze the performance of the proposed data transmission methods. We incorporate forward error-correction to reduce in-order delivery delay, and exploit a matrix signal-flow graph approach to analyze the throughput and delay of the protocols. We demonstrate and contrast the performance of the coded protocols with that of the uncoded scheme, illustrating the benefits of coded transmissions.
