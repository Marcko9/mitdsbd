We prove that two polygons $A$ and $B$ have a reversible hinged dissection (a chain hinged dissection that reverses inside and outside boundaries when folding between $A$ and $B$) if and only if $A$ and $B$ are two non-crossing nets of a common polyhedron. Furthermore, monotone hinged dissections (where all hinges rotate in the same direction when changing from $A$ to $B$ correspond exactly to non-crossing nets of a common convex polyhedron. By envelope/parcel magic, it becomes easy to design many hinged dissections.
