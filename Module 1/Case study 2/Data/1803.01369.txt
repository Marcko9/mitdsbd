Atomic-level structural changes in materials are important but challenging to study. Here, we demonstrate the dynamics and the possibility of manipulating a phosphorus dopant atom in graphene using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The mechanisms of various processes are explored and compared with those of other dopant species by first-principles calculations. This work paves the way for designing a more precise and optimized protocol for atomic engineering.
