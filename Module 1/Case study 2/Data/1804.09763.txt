We present an S-band tunable loop gap resonator (LGR) providing strong, homogeneous, and directionally uniform broadband microwave (MW) drive for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles. With 42 dBm of input power, the composite device provides drive field amplitudes approaching 5 G over a circular area $\gtrsim\!50$ mm$^2$ or cylindrical volume $\gtrsim\!250$ mm$^3$. The wide 80 MHz device bandwidth allows driving all eight NV Zeeman resonances for bias magnetic fields below 20 G. For pulsed applications the device realizes percent-scale microwave drive inhomogeneity; we measure a fractional root-mean-square inhomogeneity $σ_\text{rms}\!=\! 1.6\%$ and a peak-to-peak variation $σ_\text{pp}\!=\! 3\%$ over a circular area of 11 mm$^2$, and $σ_\text{rms} \!=\! 3.2\%$ and $σ_\text{pp}\! =\! 10.5\%$ over a larger 32 mm$^2$ circular area. We demonstrate incident MW power coupling to the LGR using multiple methodologies: a PCB-fabricated exciter antenna for deployed compact bulk sensors and an inductive coupling coil suitable for microscope-style imaging. The inductive coupling coil allows for approximately $2π$ steradian combined optical access above and below the device, ideal for envisioned and existing NV imaging and bulk sensing applications.
