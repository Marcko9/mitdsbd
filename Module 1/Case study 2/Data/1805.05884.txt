Previously, we presented a non-magnetic, nonreciprocal N-path-filter-based circulator-receiver (circ.-RX) architecture for full-duplex (FD) wireless which merges a commutation-based linear periodically-time-varying (LPTV) non-magnetic circulator with a down-converting mixer and directly provides the baseband (BB) receiver signals at its output, while suppressing the noise contribution of one set of the commutating switches. The architecture also incorporates an on-chip balance network to enhance the transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) isolation. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the architecture, including a noise analysis and an analysis of the effect of the balance network. The analyses are verified by simulation and measurement results of a 65 nm CMOS 750 MHz circulator-receiver prototype. The circulator-receiver can handle up to +8 dBm of TX power, with 8 dB noise figure (NF) and 40 dB average isolation over 20 MHz RF bandwidth (BW). In conjunction with digital self-interference (SI) and its third-order intermodulation (IM3) cancellation, the FD circ.-RX demonstrates 80 dB overall SI suppression for up to +8 dBm TX average output power. The claims are also verified through an FD demonstration where a -50 dBm weak desired received signal is recovered while transmitting a 0 dBm average-power OFDM-like TX signal.
