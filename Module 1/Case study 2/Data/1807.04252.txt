Motivated by applications in Game Theory, Optimization, and Generative Adversarial Networks, recent work of Daskalakis et al \cite{DISZ17} and follow-up work of Liang and Stokes \cite{LiangS18} have established that a variant of the widely used Gradient Descent/Ascent procedure, called "Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent (OGDA)", exhibits last-iterate convergence to saddle points in {\em unconstrained} convex-concave min-max optimization problems. We show that the same holds true in the more general problem of {\em constrained} min-max optimization under a variant of the no-regret Multiplicative-Weights-Update method called "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)". This answers an open question of Syrgkanis et al \cite{SALS15}.
  The proof of our result requires fundamentally different techniques from those that exist in no-regret learning literature and the aforementioned papers. We show that OMWU monotonically improves the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the current iterate to the (appropriately normalized) min-max solution until it enters a neighborhood of the solution. Inside that neighborhood we show that OMWU becomes a contracting map converging to the exact solution. We believe that our techniques will be useful in the analysis of the last iterate of other learning algorithms.
