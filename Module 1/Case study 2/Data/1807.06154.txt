Property by design is one appealing idea in material synthesis but hard to achieve in practice. A recent successful example is the demonstration of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures,1-3 in which atomic layers are stacked on each other and different ingredients can be combined beyond symmetry and lattice matching. This concept, usually described as a nanoscale Lego blocks, allows to build sophisticated structures layer by layer. However, this concept has been so far limited in two dimensional (2D) materials. Here we show a class of new material where different layers are coaxially (instead of planarly) stacked. As the structure is in one dimensional (1D) form, we name it "1D vdW heterostructures". We demonstrate a 5 nm diameter nanotube consisting of three different materials: an inner conductive carbon nanotube (CNT), a middle insulating hexagonal boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) and an outside semiconducting MoS2 nanotube. As the technique is highly applicable to other materials in the current 2D libraries,4-6 we anticipate our strategy to be a starting point for discovering a class of new semiconducting nanotube materials. A plethora of function-designable 1D heterostructures will appear after the combination of CNTs, BNNTs and semiconducting nanotubes.
