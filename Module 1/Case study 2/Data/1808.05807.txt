We study a multispecies generalization of a left-permeable asymmetric exclusion process (LPASEP) in one dimension with open boundaries. We determine all phases in the phase diagram using an exact projection to the LPASEP solved by us in a previous work. In most phases, we observe the phenomenon of dynamical expulsion of one or more species. We explain the density profiles in each phase using interacting shocks. This explanation is corroborated by simulations.
