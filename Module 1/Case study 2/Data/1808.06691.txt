Voltage current characteristics of a PN-junction diode are intrinsically nonlinear in nature. It is shown in this paper that a mathematical form of nonlinearity of a PN-junction diode resembles the nonlinear response of electric polarization of a dielectric medium to the electric field. Nonlinearity of a PN-junction can be expressed in a series of successively increasing orders of the nonlinearity. For a PN-junction diode, higher order nonlinear terms become significant as a voltage across the diode is increased. In this paper, a gradual emergence of a nonlinear regime with the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage is presented. Higher order harmonics are produced by utilizing the nonlinearity of a single PN-junction diode. An experimental realization of a frequency comb with the highest frequency up to the twentieth harmonics is also presented. In addition, in the same circuit by making the nonlinearity significant up to the second order, an experiment on generation of the sum and difference of frequencies is realized.
