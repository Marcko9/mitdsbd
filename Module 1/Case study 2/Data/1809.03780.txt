In this work, we have studied the isothermal compressibility ($κ_T$) as a function of temperature, baryon chemical potential and centre-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) using hadron resonance gas (HRG) and excluded-volume hadron resonance gas (EV-HRG) models. A mass cut-off dependence of isothermal compressibility has been studied for a physical resonance gas. Further, we study the effect of heavier resonances ($>$ 2 GeV) on the isothermal compressibility by considering the Hagedorn mass spectrum, $ρ(m)\sim{\exp(bm)}/{(m^2+m_0^2)^{5/4}}$. Here, the parameters, $b$ and $m_0$ are extracted after comparing the results of recent lattice QCD simulations at finite baryonic chemical potential. We find a significant difference between the results obtained in EV-HRG and HRG models at a higher temperatures and higher baryochemical potentials. The inclusion of the Hagedorn mass spectrum in the partition function for hadron gas has a large effect at a higher temperature. A higher mass cut-off in the Hagedorn mass spectrum takes the isothermal compressibility to a minimum value, which occurs near the Hagedorn temperature ($T_H$). We show explicitly that at the future low energy accelerator facilities like FAIR (CBM), Darmstadt and NICA, Dubna the created matter would be incompressible compared to the high energy facilities like RHIC and LHC.
