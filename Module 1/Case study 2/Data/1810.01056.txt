The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a leading solid-state quantum sensor for applications including magnetometry, electrometry, thermometry, and chemical sensing. However, an outstanding challenge for practical applications is that existing NV-based sensing techniques require bulky and discrete instruments for spin control and detection. Here, we address this challenge by integrating NV based quantum sensing with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Through tailored CMOS-integrated microwave generation and photodetection, this work dramatically reduces the instrumentation footprint for quantum magnetometry and thermometry. This hybrid diamond-CMOS integration enables an ultra-compact and scalable platform for quantum sensing and quantum information processing.
