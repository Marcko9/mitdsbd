We count orientations of $G(n,p)$ avoiding certain classes of oriented graphs. In particular, we study $T_r(n,p)$, the number of orientations of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ in which every copy of $K_r$ is transitive, and $S_r(n,p)$, the number of orientations of $G(n,p)$ containing no strongly connected copy of $K_r$. We give the correct order of growth of $\log T_r(n,p)$ and $\log S_r(n,p)$ up to polylogarithmic factors; for orientations with no cyclic triangle, this significantly improves a result of Allen, Kohayakawa, Mota and Parente. We also discuss the problem for a single forbidden oriented graph, and state a number of open problems and conjectures.
