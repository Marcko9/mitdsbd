The magnetic moments of baryon decuplet are studied in vacuum as well as in the symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature using a chiral SU(3) quark mean field model approach. The contributions coming from the valence quarks, quark sea and the orbital angular momentum of the quark sea have been considered to calculate magnetic moment of decuplet baryons. The decuplet baryon masses decrease, whereas, the magnetic moments increase significantly with the rise of baryonic density of the symmetric nuclear medium. This is because of the reason that constituent quark magnetic moment and the quark spin polarizations show considerable variation in the nuclear medium especially in the low temperature and baryonic density regime.
  The increase is however quantitatively less as compared to the case of octet baryon members.
