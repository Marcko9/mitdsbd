In this paper we advance a previously developed bistatic scattering forward model to include the circularly polarized incident and scattered waves, which is the case for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) reflectometry. This model development enables retrieval of soil moisture from Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) bistatic observations, e.g., from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) observations and GNSS Reflectometer Instrument for Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (GRIBSAR). In order to validate the forward model with measured data, we present a method to construct the Delay Doppler Map (DDM) from simulations of the forward model. The forward model Radar Cross Section (RCS) predictions will be compared with actual measurements. The validated model is intended for use in soil moisture retrievals.
