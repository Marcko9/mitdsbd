We propose a decentralized spatial soft-core cache placement (SSCC) policy for wireless networks. SSCC yields a spatially balanced sampling via negative dependence across caches, and can be tuned to satisfy cache size constraints with high probability. Given a desired cache hit probability, we compare the 95% confidence intervals of the required cache sizes for independent placement, hard-core placement and SSCC policies. We demonstrate that in terms of the required cache storage size, SSCC can provide up to more than 180% and 100% gains with respect to the independent and hard-core placement policies, respectively. SSCC can be used to enable proximity-based applications such as device-to-device communications and peer-to-peer networking as it promotes the item diversity and reciprocation among the nodes.
