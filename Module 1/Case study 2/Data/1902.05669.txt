We report broadband microwave absorption spectroscopy of the layered antiferromagnet CrCl3. We observe a rich structure of resonances arising from quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic dynamics. Due to the weak interlayer magnetic coupling in this material, we are able to observe both optical and acoustic branches of antiferromagnetic resonance in the GHz frequency range and a symmetry-protected crossing between them. By breaking rotational symmetry, we further show that strong magnon-magnon coupling with large tunable gaps can be induced between the two resonant modes.
