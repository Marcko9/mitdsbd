We contrast the distinct frameworks of materials design and physical learning in creating elastic networks with desired stable states. In design, the desired states are specified in advance and material parameters can be optimized on a computer with this knowledge. In learning, the material physically experiences the desired stable states in sequence, changing the material so as to stabilize each additional state. We show that while designed states are stable in networks of linear Hookean springs, sequential learning requires specific non-linear elasticity. We find that such non-linearity stabilizes states in which strain is zero in some springs and large in others, thus playing the role of Bayesian priors used in sparse statistical regression. Our model shows how specific material properties allow continuous learning of new functions through deployment of the material itself.
