Coupled microwave photon-magnon hybrid systems offer promising applications by harnessing various magnon physics. At present, in order to realize high coupling strength between the two subsystems, bulky ferromagnets with large spin numbers are utilized, which limits their potential applications for scalable quantum information processing. In this paper, by enhancing single spin coupling strength using lithographically defined superconducting resonators, we report high cooperativities between a resonator mode and a Kittel mode in nanometer thick Permalloy wires. The on-chip, lithographically scalable, and superconducting quantum circuit compatible design provides a direct route towards realizing hybrid quantum systems with nanomagnets, whose coupling strength can be precisely engineered and dynamic properties can be controlled by various mechanisms derived from spintronic studies.
