This paper presents a reconfigurable cryptographic engine that implements the DTLS protocol to enable end-to-end security for IoT. This implementation of the DTLS engine demonstrates 10x reduction in code size and 438x improvement in energy-efficiency over software. Our ECC primitive is 237x and 9x more energy-efficient compared to software and state-of-the-art hardware respectively. Pairing the DTLS engine with an on-chip RISC-V allows us to demonstrate applications beyond DTLS with up to 2 orders of magnitude energy savings.
