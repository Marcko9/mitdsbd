A Superoscillatory lens (SOL) is known to produce a sub-diffraction hotspot which is useful for high-resolution imaging. However, high-energy rings called sidelobes coexist with the central hotspot. Additionally, SOLs have not yet been directly used to image reflective objects due to low efficiency and poor imaging properties. We propose a novel reflection confocal nanoscope which mitigates these issues by relaying the SOL intensity pattern onto the object and use conventional optics for detection. We experimentally demonstrate super-resolution by imaging double bars with 330 nm separation using a 632.8 nm excitation and a 0.95 NA objective. We also discuss the enhanced contrast properties of the SOL nanoscope against a laser confocal microscope, and the degradation of performance while imaging large objects.
