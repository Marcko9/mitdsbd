We report a new method to generate uniform large-scale optical focus arrays (LOFAs). By identifying and removing undesired phase rotation in the iterative Fourier-transform algorithm (IFTA), our approach rapidly produces computer-generated holograms of highly uniform LOFAs. The new algorithm also shows faster compensation of system-induced LOFA intensity inhomogeneity than the conventional IFTA. After just three adaptive correction steps, we demonstrate LOFAs consisting of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ optical foci with $> 98\ \%$ intensity uniformity.
