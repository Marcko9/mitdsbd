We present early time light curves of 18 Type Ia supernovae observed in the first six sectors of TESS data. Nine of these supernovae were discovered by ASAS-SN, four by ATLAS, four by ZTF, and one by \textit{Gaia}. For eight of these objects with sufficient dynamic range ($>$3.0 mag from detection to peak), we fit power law models and search for signatures of companion stars. Most of our sources are consistent with fireball models where the flux increases $\propto t^2$, while two display a flatter rise with flux $\propto t$. We do not find any obvious evidence for additional structure such as multiple power law components in the early rising light curves. Assuming a favorable viewing angle, we place conservative upper limits on the radii of any companion stars of less than 25 R$_\odot$ for six supernovae and less than 4 R$_\odot$ for 4 supernovae. If such systems are commonplace, the odds of non-detection in this sample are 38\% for companions $\gtrsim$25\,R$\odot$ and 52\% for companions $\gtrsim$4\,R$\odot$. Based on the examples in this work, we expect that TESS will either detect emission from a dwarf companion during its initial two year survey, or place stringent limits on single-degenerate progenitor models.
