Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices and $J_G$ denote the corresponding binomial edge ideal in the polynomial ring $S = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n, y_1, \ldots, y_n].$ In this article, we compute the second Betti number and obtain a minimal presentation of trees and unicyclic graphs. We also classify all graphs whose binomial edge ideals are almost complete intersection and we prove that the Rees algebra of their binomial edge ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. We also obtain an explicit description of the defining ideal of the Rees algebra of those binomial edge ideals.
