The accretion-driven outbursts of young FU Orionis-type stars may be a common stage of pre-main sequence evolution and can have a significant impact on the circumstellar environment as it pertains to the growth of solids and eventually planets. This episodic accretion is thought to be sustained by additional gas in-falling from the circumstellar envelope and disk. We present APEX observations of the CO gas in the envelope around V883 Orionis, a young outbursting star. The observations mapped the $^{12}$CO(4-3), $^{12}$CO(3-2), and $^{13}$CO(3-2) lines with the FLASH$^{+}$ instrument and the $^{12}$CO(6-5) line with the SEPIA instrument. We detected high signal-to-noise emission extending out to radii $>10000$ au and calculated integrated fluxes of $1100~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(6-5), $2400~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(4-3), $1600~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{12}$CO(3-2), and $450~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$ for $^{13}$CO(3-2). We used the thermo-chemical code P{\small RO}D{\small I}M{\small O} to test several models and find the data are best described by an envelope structure with $\rm M_{env}\approx 0.2-0.4\,M_{\odot}$ and a mass-infall rate of $\rm \dot{M}_{inf}=1-2\times10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$. We infer that the observed envelope and outflow structure around V883 Ori could be caused by multiple outbursts, consistent with episodic accretion.
