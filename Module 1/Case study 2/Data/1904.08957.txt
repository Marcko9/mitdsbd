The Trigger Data Serializer (TDS) is a custom ASIC designed for the upgrade of the innermost station of the endcap ATLAS Muon Spectrometer. It is a mixed-signal chip with two working modes that can handle up to 128 detector channels. A total of 6,000 TDS ASICs have been produced for detector operation. This paper discusses a custom automatic test platform we developed to provide quality control of the TDS ASICs. We introduce the design, test procedures, and results obtained from this TDS testing platform.
