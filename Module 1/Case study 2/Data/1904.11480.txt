Let $G$ be a simple graph and $I(G)$ be its edge ideal. In this article, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of symbolic powers of edge ideals of join of graphs. As a consequence, we prove Minh's conjecture for wheel graphs, complete multipartite graphs and a subclass of co-chordal graphs. We obtain a class of graphs of regularity $3$. By constructing graphs, we prove that multiplicity of an edge ideal is independent with depth, dimension, regularity and degree of $h$-polynomial. Also, we prove that depth of an edge ideal is independent with regularity and degree of $h$-polynomial, by constructing graphs.
