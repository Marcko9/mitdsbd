The collision system and multiplicity dependence of chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{\rm ch}$) and strangeness saturation factor ($γ_{s}$) are obtained by studying the particle ratios at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. Here, we consider the new results in pp at 13 TeV, p+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, Xe+Xe at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV and Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV along with the earlier results in pp at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. A statistical thermal model is used to extract the chemical freeze-out parameters in different multiplicity classes. To understand the particle production from small to large collision systems two ensembles namely, canonical and grand canonical have been considered in this study. A clear observation of multiplicity dependence of $T_{\rm ch}$ and $γ_{s}$ is observed. The values obtained in high-multiplicity pp collisions are found to be similar to the peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. A final state midrapidity charged particle multiplicity density of around 20-30 appears to be a threshold below which, the chemical freeze-out temperature is lower than the kinetic freeze-out temperature.
