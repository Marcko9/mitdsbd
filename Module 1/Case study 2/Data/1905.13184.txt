In the present work the conjunction of chiral SU(3) model with QCD sum rules is employed to explore the possibility of $ρ$ meson condensation in neutron stars. The quark and gluon condensates in terms of which the in-medium masses of $ρ$ mesons can be expressed are calculated using the chiral SU(3) model in the charge neutral matter which is relevant for neutron stars. It is observed that condition of $ρ$ meson condensation is satisfied for the density of about 7$ρ_{0}$, where $ρ_{0}$ is the nuclear saturation density. In the end, a brief qualitative discussion of the magnetic field is also involved to check out for the further possibility of $ρ$ meson condensation.
