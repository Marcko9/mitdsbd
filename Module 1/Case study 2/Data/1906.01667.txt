We show how to produce antihelium and other antinuclei in large fractions from the decays of a new particle $φ$ that carries baryon number. Close to threshold, the production of nuclear bound states is preferred over the decay into individual nucleons, effectively decoupling antihelium and antiproton fluxes and allowing the former to dominate. $φ$ can either form dark matter itself or be produced by it, and can give rise to a flux of antihelium that is large enough to explain the preliminary antihelium events reported by AMS-02.
