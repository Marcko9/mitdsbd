The event-shape and multiplicity dependence of chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{ch}$), freeze-out radius ($R$) and strangeness saturation factor ($γ_{s}$) are obtained by studying the particle yields obtained from PYTHIA8 event generator in proton+proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Spherocity is one of the transverse event-shape techniques to isolate jetty and isotropic events in high-energy collisions and helps in looking into various observables in more differential manner. In this study, spherocity classes are divided into three categories, namely (i) Spherocity integrated, (ii) Isotropic, and (iii) Jetty. The chemical freeze-out parameters are extracted using a statistical thermal model as a function of spherocity classes and charged particle multiplicity in canonical, strangeness canonical and grand canonical ensembles. A clear observation of multiplicity and spherocity class dependence of $T_{ch}$, $R$ and $γ_{s}$ is observed. This study plays an important role in understanding the particle production mechanism in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider energies.
