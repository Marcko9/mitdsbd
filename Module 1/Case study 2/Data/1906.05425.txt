Over the past two decades, the performance of superconducting quantum circuits has tremendously improved. The progress of superconducting qubits enabled a new industry branch to emerge from global technology enterprises to quantum computing startups. Here, an overview of superconducting quantum circuit microwave control is presented. Furthermore, we discuss one of the persistent engineering challenges in the field, how to control the electromagnetic environment of increasingly complex superconducting circuits such that they are simultaneously protected and efficiently controllable.
