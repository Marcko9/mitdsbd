Integrated quantum photonic circuitry is an emerging topic that requires efficient coupling of quantum light sources to waveguides and optical resonators. So far, great effort has been devoted to engineering on-chip systems from three-dimensional crystals such as diamond or gallium arsenide. In this study, we demonstrate room temperature coupling of quantum emitters embedded within a layered hexagonal boron nitride to an on-chip aluminium nitride waveguide. We achieved 1.2% light coupling efficiency of the device and realise transmission of single photons through the waveguide. Our results serve as a foundation for the integration of layered materials with on-chip components and for the realisation of integrated quantum photonic circuitry.
