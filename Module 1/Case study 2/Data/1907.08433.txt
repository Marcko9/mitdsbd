It is unknown whether or not every polycube has an edge-unfolding. A polycube is an object constructed by gluing cubes face-to-face. An edge-unfolding cuts edges on the surface and unfolds it to a net, a non-overlapping polygon in the plane. Here we explore the more restricted edge-unzippings where the cut edges form a path. We construct two different polycubes neither of which has an edge-unzipping.
