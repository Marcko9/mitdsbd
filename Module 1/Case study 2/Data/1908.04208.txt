In the present work, we study the recent collision energy and multiplicity dependence of the charged particle transverse momentum spectra as measured by the ALICE collaboration in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV using the non-extensive Tsallis distribution and the Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave (BGBW) model. A thermodynamically consistent form of the Tsallis distribution is used to extract the kinetic freeze-out parameters from the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles at mid-rapidity. In addition, a comprehensive study of fitting range dependence of transverse momentum spectra on the freeze-out parameters is done using Tsallis statistics. The applicability of BGBW model is verified by fitting the transverse momentum spectra of the bulk part ($\sim 2.5~ {\rm GeV}/c$)for both 5.02 and 13 TeV energies and also in different multiplicity classes. The radial flow, $<Î²>$ is almost independent of collision energy and multiplicity whereas the behavior of kinetic freeze-out temperature significantly depends on multiplicity classes. It is found that the Tsallis distribution generally leads to a better description for the complete transverse momentum spectra whereas the BGBW model explains the bulk part of the system.
