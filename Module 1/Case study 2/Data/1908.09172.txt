In this article, we calculate the mass shift and decay constant of isospin averaged pseudoscalar ($D^+$,$D^0$) and scalar ($D^+_0$,$D^0_0$) mesons by the magnetic field induced quark and gluon condensates at finite density and temperature of asymmetric nuclear matter. We have calculated the in-medium chiral condensates from the chiral SU(3) mean field model and subsequently used these condensates in QCD Sum Rules (QCDSR) to calculate the effective mass and decay constant of $D$ mesons. Consideration of external magnetic field effects in hot and dense nuclear matter lead to appreciable modification in the masses and decay constants of $D$ mesons. Furthermore, we also studied the effective decay width of higher charmonium states ($ψ(3686),ψ(3770),{{χ_c}_0}(3414),{{χ_c}_2}(3556)$) as a by-product by using $^3P_0$ model which can have an important impact on the yield of $J/ψ$ mesons. The results of present work will be helpful to understand the experimental observables of the heavy ion colliders which aim to produce matter at finite density and moderate temperature.
