This article aims to introduced a new distribution named as extended xgamma (EXg) distribution. This generalization is derived from xgamma distribution (Xg), a special finite mixture of exponential and gamma distributions [see, Sen et al. ($2016$)]. Some important statistical properties, viz., survival characteristics, moments, mean deviation and random number generation have been derived. Further, maximum likelihood estimation for the estimation of the unknown parameters have also been discussed for the complete sample. The application of the proposed model has been illustrated through a real data set and observed that the proposed model might be taken as an better alternative to some well known lifetime distributions.
