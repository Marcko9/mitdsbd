Consider two sequences of $n$ independent and identically distributed fair coin tosses, $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ and $Y=(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)$, which are $ρ$-correlated for each $j$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}[X_j=Y_j] = {1+ρ\over 2}$. We study the question of how large (small) the probability $\mathbb{P}[X \in A, Y\in B]$ can be among all sets $A,B\subset\{0,1\}^n$ of a given cardinality. For sets $|A|,|B| = Θ(2^n)$ it is well known that the largest (smallest) probability is approximately attained by concentric (anti-concentric) Hamming balls, and this can be easily proved via the Nelson-Bonami-Beckner hypercontrictive inequality (reverse hypercontractivity). Here we consider the case of $|A|,|B| = 2^{-Θ(n)}$. By applying a recent extension of the hypercontractive inequality of Polyanskiy-Samorodnitsky (J. Functional Analysis, 2019), we show that Hamming balls approximately maximize $\mathbb{P}[X \in A, Y\in B]$ in the regime of $ρ\to 1$. We also prove a similar tight lower bound, i.e. show that for $ρ\to 0$ the pair of opposite Hamming balls approximately minimizes the probability $\mathbb{P}[X \in A, Y\in B]$.
