In this paper we consider the problem of encoding data into repeat-free sequences in which sequences are imposed to contain any $k$-tuple at most once (for predefined $k$). First, the capacity and redundancy of the repeat-free constraint are calculated. Then, an efficient algorithm, which uses a single bit of redundancy, is presented to encode length-$n$ sequences for $k=2+2\log (n)$. This algorithm is then improved to support any value of $k$ of the form $k=a\log (n)$, for $1<a$, while its redundancy is $o(n)$. We also calculate the capacity of repeat-free sequences when combined with local constraints which are given by a constrained system, and the capacity of multi-dimensional repeat-free codes.
