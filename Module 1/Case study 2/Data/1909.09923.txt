Effective congestion control for data center networks is becoming increasingly challenging with rapidly increasing workload demand, ever faster links, small average transfer sizes, extremely bursty traffic, limited switch buffer capacity, and latency-sensitive applications. Widely deployed algorithms, such as DCTCP and DCQCN, are still far from optimal in many plausible scenarios, particularly for tail latency. Many operators compensate by running their networks at low average utilization, dramatically increasing costs.
  In this paper, we argue that we have reached the practical limits of end-to-end congestion control. Instead, we propose a new clean slate design based on hop-by-hop per-flow flow control. We show that our approach achieves near optimal tail latency behavior even under challenging conditions such as high link utilization and in-cast cross traffic. By contrast with prior hop-by-hop schemes, we show that per-flow flow control requires only limited metadata and packet buffering.
