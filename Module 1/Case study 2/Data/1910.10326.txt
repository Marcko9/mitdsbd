We study the magnon transport in the nonlocal configuration composed of two Pt strips on top of yttrium iron garnet, with and without the presence of RF microwave generated by an on-chip antenna. We find that the spin-Hall induced thermal magnon heating/cooling, the Oersted field as well as the Joule heating generated by the a.c. current in the Pt injector can significantly influence the spin-pumping signal measured by the Pt detector in the presence of RF microwave, forcing the spin-pumping voltage to show up in the first and second harmonic signals in the nonlocal magnon transport measurement. These results indicate that nonlocal magnon transport configuration can serve as a structure to electrically detect and manipulate the spin-pumping signal. Furthermore, certain caution is needed when studying the interplay between incoherent magnon and coherent magnon spin transport in the nonlocal transport configuration, since the change in microwave-induced spin-pumping voltage can overwhelm the incoherent magnon transport signals.
