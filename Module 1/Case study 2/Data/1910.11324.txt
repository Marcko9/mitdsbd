In this paper we determine the number and typical structure of sets of integers with bounded doubling. In particular, improving recent results of Green and Morris, and of Mazur, we show that the following holds for every fixed $λ> 2$ and every $k \geqslant (\log n)^4$: if $ω\to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ (arbitrarily slowly), then almost all sets $A \subset [n]$ with $|A| = k$ and $|A + A| \leqslant λk$ are contained in an arithmetic progression of length $λk/2 + ω$.
