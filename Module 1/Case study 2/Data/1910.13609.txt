Recent discoveries of broad classes of quantum materials have spurred fundamental study of what quantum phases can be reached and stabilized, and have suggested intriguing practical applications based on control over transitions between quantum phases with different electrical, magnetic, and$/$or optical properties. Tabletop generation of strong terahertz (THz) light fields has set the stage for dramatic advances in our ability to drive quantum materials into novel states that do not exist as equilibrium phases. However, THz-driven irreversible phase transitions are still unexplored. Large and doping-tunable energy barriers between multiple phases in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) provide a testbed for THz polymorph engineering. Here we report experimental demonstration of an irreversible phase transition in 2D MoTe$_{2}$ from a semiconducting hexagonal phase (2H) to a predicted topological insulator distorted octahedral ($1T^{'}$) phase induced by field-enhanced terahertz pulses. This is achieved by THz field-induced carrier liberation and multiplication processes that result in a transient high carrier density that favors the $1T^{'}$ phase. Single-shot time-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements following THz excitation reveal that the transition out of the 2H phase occurs within 10 ns. This observation opens up new possibilities of THz-based phase patterning and has implications for ultrafast THz control over quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.
