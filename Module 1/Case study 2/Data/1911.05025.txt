MASCARA-4 b is a hot Jupiter in a highly-misaligned orbit around a rapidly-rotating A3V star that was observed for 54 days by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\tess). We perform two analyses of MASCARA-4 b using a stellar gravity-darkened model. First, we measure MASCARA-4 b's misaligned orbital configuration by modeling its \tess~photometric light curve. We take advantage of the asymmetry in MASCARA-4 b's transit due to its host star's gravity-darkened surface to measure MASCARA-4 b's true spin-orbit angle to be $104^{\circ+7^\circ}_{-13^\circ}$. We also detect a $\sim4Ïƒ$ secondary eclipse at $0.491\pm0.007$ orbital phase, proving that the orbit is slightly eccentric. Second, we model MASCARA-4 b's insolation including gravity-darkening and find that the planet's received XUV flux varies by $4$\% throughout its orbit. MASCARA-4 b's short-period, polar orbit suggests that the planet likely underwent dramatic orbital evolution to end up in its present-day configuration and that it receives a varying stellar irradiance that perpetually forces the planet out of thermal equilibrium. These findings make MASCARA-4 b an excellent target for follow-up characterization to better understand orbital evolution and current-day of planets around high-mass stars.
