Visual foresight gives an agent a window into the future, which it can use to anticipate events before they happen and plan strategic behavior. Although impressive results have been achieved on video prediction in constrained settings, these models fail to generalize when confronted with unfamiliar real-world objects. In this paper, we tackle the generalization problem via fast adaptation, where we train a prediction model to quickly adapt to the observed visual dynamics of a novel object. Our method, Experience-embedded Visual Foresight (EVF), jointly learns a fast adaptation module, which encodes observed trajectories of the new object into a vector embedding, and a visual prediction model, which conditions on this embedding to generate physically plausible predictions. For evaluation, we compare our method against baselines on video prediction and benchmark its utility on two real-world control tasks. We show that our method is able to quickly adapt to new visual dynamics and achieves lower error than the baselines when manipulating novel objects.
