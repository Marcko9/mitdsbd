A coupled dielectric-metal metasurface (CDMM) consisting of amorphous silicon (a-$\textit{Si}$) rings and subwavelength holes in $\textit{Au}$ layer separated by a $\textit{SiO}_{2}$ layer is presented. The design parameters of the CDMM is numerically optimized to have a polarization independent peak transmittance of 0.55 at 1540 nm with a Full Width at Half Maximum ($FWHM$) of 10 nm. The filter also has a 100 nm quite zone with $\sim 10^{-2}$ transmittance. A radiating two-oscillator model reveals the fundamental resonances in the filter which interfere to produce the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) like effect. Multipole expansion of the currents in the structure validates the fundamental resonances predicted by the two-oscillator model. The presented CDMM filter is robust to artifacts in device fabrication and has performances comparable to a conventional Fabry-PÃ©rot filter. However, it is easier to be integrated in image sensors as the transmittance peak can be tuned by only changing the periodicity resulting in a planar structure with a fixed height.
