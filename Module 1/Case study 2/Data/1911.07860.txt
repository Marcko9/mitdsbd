Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for secure communications safe against attacks by quantum computers. QKD protocols are performed by sending a sizeable, but finite, number of quantum signals between the distant parties involved. Many QKD experiments however predict their achievable key rates using asymptotic formulas, which assume the transmission of an infinite number of signals, partly because QKD proofs with finite transmissions (and finite key lengths) can be difficult. Here we develop a robust numerical approach for calculating the key rates for QKD protocols in the finite-key regime in terms of two novel semi-definite programs (SDPs). The first uses the relation between smooth min-entropy and quantum relative entropy, and the second uses the relation between the smooth min-entropy and quantum fidelity. We then solve these SDPs using convex optimization solvers and obtain some of the first numerical calculations of finite key rates for several different protocols, such as BB84, B92, and twin-field QKD. Our numerical approach democratizes the composable security proofs for QKD protocols where the derived keys can be used as an input to another cryptosystem.
