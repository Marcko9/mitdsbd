A rateless transmission architecture is developed for communication over Gaussian intersymbol interference channels, based on the concept of super-Nyquist (SNQ) signaling. In such systems, the signaling rate is chosen significantly higher than the Nyquist rate of the system. We show that such signaling, when used in conjunction with good "off-the-shelf" base codes, simple linear redundancy, and minimum mean-square error decision feedback equalization, results in capacity-approaching, low-complexity rateless codes for the time-varying intersymbol-interference channel. Constructions for both single-input / single-output (SISO) and multi-input / multi-output (MIMO) ISI channels are developed.
