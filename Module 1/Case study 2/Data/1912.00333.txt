We investigate the effect of lattice disorder and local correlation effects in finite and periodic silicene structures caused by doping with carbon atoms using first-principles calculations. For both finite and periodic silicene structures, we show that the electronic properties of carbon-doped silicene structures are dramatically changed by controlling only one parameter, the position of substitution of carbon atoms in the structures which is related to the amount of disorder introduced in the lattice and electron-electron correlation effects. In terms of silicene structure, finite structures are representations of the freely doped systems, while periodic structures represent different conditions of growth scenarios. By changing the position of the carbon dopants, we found that the Mott and Anderson insulators can be continuously connected as shown by the local density of states. Moreover, the bandgap is determined by the level of lattice disorder and electronic correlation effects. Finally, these structures are ferromagnetic even under disorder which has potential applications in Si-based nanoelectronics, such as field-effect transistors (FETs).
