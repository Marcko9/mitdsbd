Noise that exhibits significant temporal and spatial correlations across multiple qubits can be especially harmful to both fault-tolerant quantum computation and quantum-enhanced metrology. However, a complete spectral characterization of the noise environment of even a two-qubit system has not been reported thus far. We propose and experimentally validate a protocol for two-qubit dephasing noise spectroscopy based on continuous control modulation. By combining ideas from spin-locking relaxometry with a statistically motivated robust estimation approach, our protocol allows for the simultaneous reconstruction of all the single-qubit and two-qubit cross-correlation spectra, including access to their distinctive non-classical features. Only single-qubit control manipulations and state-tomography measurements are employed, with no need for entangled-state preparation or readout of two-qubit observables. While our experimental validation uses two superconducting qubits coupled to a shared engineered noise source, our methodology is portable to a variety of dephasing-dominated qubit architectures. By pushing quantum noise spectroscopy beyond the single-qubit setting, our work paves the way to characterizing spatiotemporal correlations in both engineered and naturally occurring noise environments.
