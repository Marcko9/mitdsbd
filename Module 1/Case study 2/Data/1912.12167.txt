This paper describes various design considerations for deep neural networks that enable them to operate efficiently and accurately on processing-in-memory accelerators. We highlight important properties of these accelerators and the resulting design considerations using experiments conducted on various state-of-the-art deep neural networks with the large-scale ImageNet dataset.
