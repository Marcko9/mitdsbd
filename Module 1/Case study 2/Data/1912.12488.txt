In condensed matter systems, coherent backscattering and quantum interference in the presence of time-reversal symmetry lead to well-known phenomena such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF). Here we use multi-pass Landau-Zener transitions at the avoided crossing of a highly-coherent superconducting qubit to emulate these phenomena. The average and standard deviation of the qubit transition rate exhibit a dip and peak when the driving waveform is time-reversal symmetric, corresponding to WL and UCF, respectively. The higher coherence of this qubit enabled the realization of both effects, in contrast to earlier work arXiv:1204.6428, which successfully emulated UCF, but did not observe WL. This demonstration illustrates the use of non-adiabatic control to implement quantum emulation with superconducting qubits.
