This paper studies the capacities of input-driven finite-state channels, i.e., channels whose current state is a time-invariant deterministic function of the previous state and the current input. We lower bound the capacity of such a channel using a dynamic programming formulation of a bound on the maximum reverse directed information rate. We show that the dynamic programming-based bounds can be simplified by solving the corresponding Bellman equation explicitly. In particular, we provide analytical lower bounds on the capacities of $(d, k)$-runlength-limited input-constrained binary symmetric and binary erasure channels. Furthermore, we provide a single-letter lower bound based on a class of input distributions with memory.
