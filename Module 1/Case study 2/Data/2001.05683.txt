Mt. Abu Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (MFOSC-P) is an in-house developed instrument for Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) 1.2m telescope at Mt. Abu India, commissioned in February 2019. Here we present the first science results derived from the low resolution spectroscopy program of a sample of M Dwarfs carried out during the commissioning run of MFOSC-P between February-June 2019. M dwarfs carry great significance for exoplanets searches in habitable zone and are among the promising candidates for the observatory's several ongoing observational campaigns. Determination of their accurate atmospheric properties and fundamental parameters is essential to constrain both their atmospheric and evolutionary models. In this study, we provide a low resolution (R$\sim$500) spectroscopic catalogue of 80 bright M dwarfs (J$<$10) and classify them using their optical spectra. We have also performed the spectral synthesis and $Ï‡^2$ minimisation techniques to determine their fundamental parameters viz. effective temperature and surface gravity by comparing the observed spectra with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra. Spectral type of M dwarfs in our sample ranges from M0 to M5. The derived effective temperature and surface gravity are ranging from 4000 K to 3000 K and 4.5 to 5.5 dex, respectively. In most of the cases, the derived spectral types are in good agreement with previously assigned photometric classification.
