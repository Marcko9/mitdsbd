We address the problem of efficient exploration for learning lifted operators in sequential decision-making problems without extrinsic goals or rewards. Inspired by human curiosity, we propose goal-literal babbling (GLIB), a simple and general method for exploration in such problems. GLIB samples goals that are conjunctions of literals, which can be understood as specific, targeted effects that the agent would like to achieve in the world, and plans to achieve these goals using the operators being learned. We conduct a case study to elucidate two key benefits of GLIB: robustness to overly general preconditions and efficient exploration in domains with effects at long horizons. We also provide theoretical guarantees and further empirical results, finding GLIB to be effective on a range of benchmark planning tasks.
