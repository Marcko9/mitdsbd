The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy of transfer learning techniques and transformer-based models as applied to medical natural language processing (NLP) tasks, specifically radiological text classification. We used 1,977 labeled head CT reports, from a corpus of 96,303 total reports, to evaluate the efficacy of pretraining using general domain corpora and a combined general and medical domain corpus with a bidirectional representations from transformers (BERT) model for the purpose of radiological text classification. Model performance was benchmarked to a logistic regression using bag-of-words vectorization and a long short-term memory (LSTM) multi-label multi-class classification model, and compared to the published literature in medical text classification. The BERT models using either set of pretrained checkpoints outperformed the logistic regression model, achieving sample-weighted average F1-scores of 0.87 and 0.87 for the general domain model and the combined general and biomedical-domain model. General text transfer learning may be a viable technique to generate state-of-the-art results within medical NLP tasks on radiological corpora, outperforming other deep models such as LSTMs. The efficacy of pretraining and transformer-based models could serve to facilitate the creation of groundbreaking NLP models in the uniquely challenging data environment of medical text.
