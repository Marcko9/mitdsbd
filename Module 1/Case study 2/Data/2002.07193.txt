Recent progress in nonlinear optical materials and microresonators has brought quantum computing with bulk optical nonlinearities into the realm of possibility. This platform is of great interest, not only because photonics is an obvious choice for quantum networks, but also because it may be the only feasible route to quantum information processing at room temperature. We introduce a paradigm for room-temperature photonic quantum logic that significantly simplifies the realization of various quantum circuits, and in particular, of error correction. It uses only the strongest available bulk nonlinearity, namely the $Ï‡^{(2)}$ nonlinear susceptibility. The key element is a three-mode resonator that implements programmable bosonic quantum logic gates. We show that just two of these elements suffice for a complete, compact error-correction circuit on a bosonic code, without the need for measurement or feed-forward control. An extrapolation of current progress in nonlinear optical materials and photonic circuits indicates that such circuitry should be achievable within the next decade.
