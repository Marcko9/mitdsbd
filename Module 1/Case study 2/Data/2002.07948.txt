The goal of federated learning is to design algorithms in which several agents communicate with a central node, in a privacy-protecting manner, to minimize the average of their loss functions. In this approach, each node not only shares the required computational budget but also has access to a larger data set, which improves the quality of the resulting model. However, this method only develops a common output for all the agents, and therefore, does not adapt the model to each user data. This is an important missing feature especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various agents. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated learning in which our goal is to find a shared initial model in a distributed manner that can be slightly updated by either a current or a new user by performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to its own loss function. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning architecture while leading to a more personalized model for each user. We show this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework. Inspired by this connection, we propose a personalized variant of the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric.
