The Standard Model (SM) when extended with a Leptoquark (LQ) and right handed neutrinos, can have interesting new implications for Higgs physics. We show that the sterile neutrinos can induce a significant boost to the down-type quark Yukawa interactions through a diagonal coupling associated with the quarks and a scalar LQ of electromagnetic charge $1/3$. The relative change is much more pronounced in case of the first two generations of quarks as they have vanishingly small Yukawa couplings in the SM. The enhancement in the couplings would also lead to a non-negligible contribution of the quark fusion process to the production of the 125 GeV Higgs scalar in the SM, though the gluon fusion always dominates. However, this may not be true for a general scalar. As an example, we consider a scenario with a SM-gauge-singlet scalar $φ$ where an $\mathcal O(1)$ coupling between $φ$ and the LQ is allowed. The $φq \bar{q}$ Yukawa couplings can only be generated radiatively through a loop of LQ and sterile neutrinos. Here, the quark fusion process can have significant cross section, specially for a light $φ$. It can even supersede the normally dominant gluon fusion process for a moderate to large value of the LQ mass. This model can be tested/constrained at the high luminosity run of the LHC through a potentially large branching fraction of the scalar to two-jets.
