Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) markets are a market-based system designed to incentivize solar energy generation. A regulatory body imposes a lower bound on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate via solar means, providing them with a certificate for each MWh generated. Regulated firms seek to navigate the market to minimize the cost imposed on them, by modulating their SREC generation and trading activities. As such, the SREC market can be viewed through the lens of a large stochastic game with heterogeneous agents, where agents interact through the market price of the certificates. We study this stochastic game by solving the mean-field game (MFG) limit with sub-populations of heterogeneous agents. Our market participants optimize costs accounting for trading frictions, cost of generation, non-linear non-compliance penalty, and generation uncertainty. Moreover, we endogenize SREC price through market clearing. Using techniques from variational analysis, we characterize firms' optimal controls as the solution of McKean-Vlasov (MV) FBSDEs and determine the equilibrium SREC price. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution to this MV-FBSDE, and further prove that the MFG strategies have the $Îµ$-Nash property for the finite player game. Finally, we develop a numerical scheme for solving the MV-FBSDEs and conclude by demonstrating how firms behave in equilibrium using simulated examples.
