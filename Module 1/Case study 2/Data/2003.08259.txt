Spin glass models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, Hopfield and Ising models, are all well-studied members of the exponential family of discrete distributions, and have been influential in a number of application domains where they are used to model correlation phenomena on networks. Conventionally these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group effects. Using a {\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength of the peer-group effects. The heart of our result is a novel approach for showing strong concavity of the log pseudo-likelihood of the model, implying statistical error rate of $\sqrt{d/n}$ for the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE), where $d$ is the dimensionality of the covariate vectors and $n$ is the size of the network (number of nodes). Our model generalizes vanilla logistic regression as well as the peer-effect models studied in recent works, and our results extend these results to accommodate higher-order interactions.
