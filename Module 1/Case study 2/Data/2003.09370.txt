Digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world object that lives simultaneously with its physical counterpart. Since its first introduction in 2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of applications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial intelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.
