Energy carrier transport and recombination in emerging semiconductors can be directly monitored with optical microscopy, leading to the measurement of the diffusion coefficient (D), a critical property for the design of efficient optoelectronic devices. The diffusion coefficient is often determine by fitting a time-resolved expanding carrier profile after optical excitation using a Mean Squared Displacement Model. Although this approach has gained widespread adoption, there is no clear consensus as to which material systems, and under what experimental conditions (i.e. laser fluence), it can be applied. Here, we simulate diffusion processes in both excitonic and free carrier semiconductors and present a tailorable MSD Model that can accurately predict D for various materials. For perovskites, it is most accurate when sample D values are > 1 cm$^2$ s$^-$$^1$ and excitation densities are < 1x10$^1$$^6$ cm$^-$$^3$. At higher carrier densities, non-linear recombination terms can dominate the expansion of the carrier profile and lead to fitting error. We find that differences in grain size and boundary behavior, present in most thin films, can lead to distinct profiles that are not captured by MSD Models. Finally, we present clear strategies to investigate and control energy transport in disordered materials for more effective design and optimization of electronic and optoelectronic devices.
