Thermodynamical properties of asymmetric strange quark matter using the Polyakov Chiral $\text{SU(3)}$ quark mean field (PCQMF) model at finite temperature and chemical potential have been investigated. Within the PCQMF model, the properties of quark matter are calculated through the scalar fields $σ$, $ζ$, $δ$ and $χ$, the vector fields $ω$, $ρ$ and $φ$ and the Polyakov loop fields $Φ$ and $\barΦ$. The isospin splitting of constituent quark masses is observed at large isospin asymmetry. The effect of temperature and strangeness fraction on energy per baryon and equation of state is found to be appreciable in quark matter. The effect of the Polyakov loop dynamics on several thermodynamical bulk quantities such as energy density, entropy density, and trace anomaly is presented and compared with recent lattice QCD results.
