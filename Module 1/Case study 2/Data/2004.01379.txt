We observed the impact of finite magnetic field on the in-medium mass and decay constant of isospin averaged vector $D^*(D^{*^+},D^{*^0})$ and axial-vector $D_1(D^+_1, D^0_1)$ mesons. The quark and gluon condensates of the nuclear medium at finite magnetic field, temperature, isospin asymmetry, and density have been obtained by the meson exchange scalar fields within the chiral SU(3) model. The medium attributes modify the scalar and vector density of nuclear medium and this variation reflects in the in-medium mass and decay constant of spin 1 $D$ mesons. We calculate these observables by comparing the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and the phenomenological side in the QCD Sum Rules. In the results, we observed a positive mass shift for charged vector and axial-vector $D$ mesons with respect to magnetic field. For neutral vector (axial-vector) $D$ mesons we observed negative (positive) mass shift as a function of magnetic field. In the application part, we calculate the in-medium partial decay width of the process $D^*_s$(2715/2860) $\rightarrow$ $D^* K$ by using $^3P_0$ model. The in-medium effects are incorporated through the in-medium masses of $D^*$ and $K$ mesons.
