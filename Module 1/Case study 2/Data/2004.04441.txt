Orchestrated collaborative effort of physical and cyber components to satisfy given requirements is the central concept behind Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To duly ensure the performance of components, a software-based resilience manager is a flexible choice to detect and recover from faults quickly. However, a single resilience manager, placed at the centre of the system to deal with every fault, suffers from decision-making overburden; and therefore, is out of the question for distributed large-scale CPS. On the other hand, prompt detection of failures and efficient recovery from them are challenging for decentralised resilience managers. In this regard, we present a novel resilience management framework that utilises the concept of management hierarchy. System design contracts play a key role in this framework for prompt fault-detection and recovery. Besides the details of the framework, an Industry 4.0 related test case is presented in this article to provide further insights.
