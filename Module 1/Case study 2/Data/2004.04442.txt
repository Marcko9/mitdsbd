As the industrial cyber-infrastructure become increasingly important to realise the objectives of Industry~4.0, the consequence of disruption due to internal or external faults become increasingly severe. Thus there is a need for a resilient infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a contract-based methodology where components across layers of the cyber-infrastructure are associated with contracts and a light-weight resilience manager. This allows the system to detect faults (contract violation monitored using observers) and react (change contracts dynamically) effectively.
