In this work, relative Underlying Event (UE) transverse multiplicity activity classifier ($R_{\rm {T}}$) is used to study the strange and multi-strange hadron production in proton-proton collisions. Our study with $R_{\rm {T}}$ would allow to disentangle these particles which are originating from the soft and hard QCD processes. We have used the PYTHIA 8 MC with different implementation of color reconnection and rope hydronisation models to demonstrate the proton-proton collisions data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The relative production of strange and multi-strange hadrons are discussed extensively in low and high transverse activity region. In this contribution, the relative strange hadron production is enhanced with increasing $R_{\rm {T}}$. This enhancement is significant for strange baryons as compared to mesons. In addition, the particle ratios as a function of $R_{\rm {T}}$ confirms the baryon enhancement in newCR, whereas Rope model confirms the baryon enhancement only with strange quark content. An experimental confirmation of such results will provide more insight into the soft physics in the transverse region which will be useful to investigate various tunes based on hadronization and color reconnection schemes.
