Electron-electron interactions (EEIs) in 2D van der Waals structures is one of the topics with high current interest in physics. We report the observation of a negative parabolic magnetoresistance (MR) in multilayer 2D semiconductor InSe beyond the low-field weak localization/antilocalization regime, and provide evidence for the EEI origin of this MR behavior. Further, we analyze this negative parabolic MR and other observed quantum transport signatures of EEIs (temperature dependent conductance and Hall coefficient) within the framework of Fermi liquid theory and extract the gate voltage tunable Fermi liquid parameter $F_0^Ïƒ$ which quantifies the electron spin-exchange interaction strength.
