With rapid advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, electrical devices in the near future is expected to have IoT capabilities. This enables fine-grained tracking of individual energy consumption data of such devices, offering location-independent per-device billing. Thus, it is more fine-grained than the location-based metering of state-of-the-art infrastructure, which traditionally aggregates on a building or household level, defining the entity to be billed. However, such in-device energy metering is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized metering architecture that enables devices with IoT capabilities to measure their own energy consumption. In this architecture, the device-level consumption is additionally reported to a system-level aggregator that verifies distributed information and provides secure data storage using Blockchain, preventing data manipulation by untrusted entities. Using evaluations on an experimental testbed, we show that the proposed architecture supports device mobility and enables location-independent monitoring of energy consumption.
