We investigate the effect of different types of non-unitary quantum channels on multi-qubit quantum systems. For an $n$-qubit system and a particular channel, in order to draw unbiased conclusions about the system as a whole as opposed to specific states, we evolve a large number of randomly generated states under the given channel. We increase the number of qubits and study the effect of system size on the decoherence processes. The entire scheme is repeated for various types of environments which include dephasing channel, depolarising channel, collective dephasing channel and zero temperature bath. Non-unitary channels representing the environments are modeled via their Karus operator decomposition or master equation approach. Further, for a given $n$ we restrict ourselves to the study of particular subclasses of entangled states, namely the GHZ-type and W-type states. We generate random states within these classes and study the class behaviors under different quantum channels for various values of $n$.
